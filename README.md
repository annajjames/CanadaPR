## Introduction

Canada has always been one of the countries with a large immigrant population in the world. There are around 300 to 500K PR applicants each year 
according to the data source provided by the Government of Canada. Our group is curious about the push factors and the soci-economic status of the applicants'
countries.

We discovered that Human Development Index (HDI) is a good index which lets us understand the achievement in key dimensions of human development
of the applicant's countries. The three dimensions of HDI are: 
- Life expectancy at birth 
- Average years spent in schooling 
- Gross National Income (GNI)

In this project we have analysed and compared these key HDI dimensions as well as the population, unemployment rate, and percentage of educated population of the countries with the most number of PR applications to Canada.

### Key Findings

#### Human Development Index:
- In contradiction to our hypothesis that the most number of PR applications to Canada will be from the ‘low’ HDI group, only 17.7 % of applications come from the ‘low’ HDI group. The top countries in the ‘low’ HDI group being Nigeria and Eriteria.

- A high concentration of applications come from specific countries in the 'medium' and 'high' HDI groups. India from the ‘medium’ group, and China and Phillippines from the ‘high’ group.
- When we consider the percentage of PR applications in proportion to the population of the country, the top 9 countries are from the Caribbean region with 41% of the total population of St Vincent and Grenadines applying for PR to Canada. In comparison, only 0.007% of the Indian population is applying for PR to Canada.

- At 43% Eriteria has the highest percentage of PR applications to Canada in proportion to its population.
- Except Guyana which is ‘medium’ hdi, the top 9 countries from the Caribbean region fall under the ‘high’HDI category.

#### Gross National Income:

- The difference between the GNI of Canada and the top 3 countries India, China, Phillippines is greater than 100%.
- The difference between GNI of Canada and the 9 Caribbean countries is also greater than 100%.
- GNI could be one of the deciding factors why citizens from these countries choose to emigrate to Canada.

#### Life Expectancy:
- At 82 years life expectancy in Canada and France are higher than all the countries.

#### Average schooling years:
- At 13 years, average schooling years in n Canada and United States is higher than the other countries.

#### Educated population:
- In Canada, 100% of the population over age 25 have some level of secondary education which is not the case in other countries.

#### Unemployment rate:
- For most countries in the Caribbean region unemployment rate is very high which is a likely factor for influencing PR applications.
- France, a country from the ‘very high’ HDI group has high unemployment rate at 8.5% for 2019 which could be a likely factor, in addition to cultural similarities.
- Unemployment rate of Canada for 2019 is less than 6%
