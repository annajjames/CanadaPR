## Introduction

Canada has always been one of the countries with a large immigrant population in the world. There are around 300~500K PR applicants each year 
according to the data source provided by the Government of Canada. Our group is curious about the push factors and the soci-economic status of the applicants'
countries. 
We discovered that Human Development Index (HDI) is a good index which lets us understand the achievement in key dimensions of human development
of these countries. The three dimensions of HDI are: life expectancy at birth, average years spent in schooling, and Gross National Income (GNI). 

In this project we have analysed and compared these key dimensions of HDI of countries with the most number of PR applications to Canada. Further, we
have also looked at the factors like the country's total population, unemployment rate, and percentage of educated population.
